Project Title:
Number Guessing Game

Project Description:
This project is a simple number guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 10, and the user attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess is too low or too high until they correctly guess the number. Once the user guesses the number correctly, the game ends.

Key Achievements:
â€¢	Implemented a functional number guessing game.
â€¢	Provided real-time feedback to the user on the accuracy of their guesses.
â€¢	Demonstrated basic user input and conditional branching in a Python program.

Technologies Used:
Python

Challenges:
â€¢	Ensuring that the game provided accurate feedback to the user based on their guesses.
â€¢	Managing the user input and handling it appropriately to maintain a smooth user experience.
â€¢	Adhering to the game's logic while considering different possible outcomes and user interactions.
