<h2>Project Title:</h2>
Mean, Median and Mode using Python

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
This project involves performing basic statistical analysis on a given numeric dataset represented by the list list1. The analysis includes calculating the mean, median, and mode of the dataset.

<h2>Key Achievements:</h2>
•	&nbsp; Mean Calculation: The project successfully calculates the mean of the dataset using the formula mean = sum(list1) / len(list1). This provides a measure of the dataset's central tendency.

•	&nbsp; Median Calculation: The project effectively calculates the median of the dataset. It handles both even and odd-length lists correctly, ensuring accurate results.

•	&nbsp; Mode Calculation: The project correctly computes the mode of the dataset by creating a frequency dictionary and identifying the element with the highest frequency.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
Python

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
The main challenge in this project was implementing the median calculation correctly, accounting for both even and odd-length lists. Additionally, creating a frequency dictionary and finding the mode required careful handling of the data to ensure accurate results.
